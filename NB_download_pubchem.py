################## Reading in the PubChem data #############################
### the goal here is to end up with a celan python list of rdkit Mol objects
suppl = rd.SDMolSupplier('../Compound_000000001_000500000.sdf')
suppl_indices=np.arange(len(suppl))

# these should be the same
len(suppl_indices) # 443086
len(suppl) # 443086
# NOTE: CHANGE THE SIZE OF n HERE TO SOMETHING SMALLER IF YOU'RE GOING TO MESS WITH THIS SCRIPT OTHERWISE IT WILL TAKE FOREVER TO RUN
n=1000
rand_indices = np.random.choice(suppl_indices, size=n, replace=False)

# Now the task is to create a more manageable subset of the data by writing a for loop that will loop through ran_indices
# (so that the size is n), and add suppl[random_indices[i]] to the subset each iteration.

# you need the int() function to convert i from an object type 'numpy.int32' into a plain basic python int
# type(rand_indices[0]) # will return 'numpy.int32'
# type(int(rand_indices[0])) # will return 'int'
ranSamp=[]
for i in rand_indices:
   ranSamp.append(suppl[int(i)]) 

len(ranSamp) # should be equal to n
ranSamp[0] # should be the first item
type(ranSamp[0]) # the objects in this array are rdkit Mol objects


# This was throwing an error because  for whatever reason, rdkit couldn't make some of the odjects from our .sdf file into Mol objects
# for mol in ranSamp:
#    mol.GetNumAtoms()

# to figure out just how many or our objects were correctly converted to Mol objects, I created this simple counter:
# x = 0
# for i in ranSamp:
#   if i is not None:
#       x += 1
#       print(x)
# which returns 9982 iterations, which means that 18/10000 objects were not succesfully converted to Mol objects. Not bad.
# We'll just have to make a loop to have to remove the 18 objects of type None
theMols = []
for i in np.arange(len(ranSamp)):
   if ranSamp[i] is not None:
      theMols.append(ranSamp[i])
len(theMols) # should be a bit less than n

# This saves the mol object list as an .npy object that can be loaded into other scripts.
np.save("theMols.npy",theMols, allow_pickle=True)
# note that when you load in the .npy object, it is now an np.array rather than a list -> so np.save must convert a list to array.
x=np.load("theMols.npy", allow_pickle=True)
print(x[0])

# Now we have a list (NOT numpy array) of our complete Mol objects called theMols

################### Calculating QED Properties #############################
### make a dataframe of QED properties for each mol
##### will probaly want to add more properties later for Ghose method

# df=pd.DataFrame(columns=["MW", "ALOGP", "HBA", "HBD", "PSA", "ROTB", "AROM", "ALERTS","QED"])

# for i in np.arange(len(theMols)):
#    row=list(QED.properties(theMols[i]))
#    row.append(QED.default(theMols[i]))
#    df.loc[len(df.index)]=row

# df.to_csv("PubChemData.csv",index=False)
# print("done")
